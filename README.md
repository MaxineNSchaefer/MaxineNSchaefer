### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a PhD student at the University of South Africa. I'm exploring the longitudinal relationship between phonological processing and reading in bilingual children in South Africa. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've done 111 parkruns in South Africa. I can't wait to do one out of the country when we can travel again!
