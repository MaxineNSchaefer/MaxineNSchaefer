### Hi there 👋

- 📚 I'm a PhD student at the University of South Africa. I'm exploring the longitudinal relationship between phonological processing and reading in bilingual children in South Africa. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R.
- 💡 I'm also interested in open science, and try to convince others of the merits of a more open academy.
- 🏃‍♀️ Fun fact: I've done 111 parkruns, all in South Africa. I can't wait to do one out of the country when we can travel again!
