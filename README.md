### Hi there 👋

- 📚 I'm a PhD student at the University of South Africa. I'm exploring the longitudinal relationship between phonological processing and reading in bilingual children in South Africa. 
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my R skills (for my own research), and am also working with STATA (at work).
- 💡 I'm also interested in open science, and try to convince others of the merits of a more open academy.
- 🏃 Fun fact: I've done 136 parkruns, all in South Africa. I can't wait to do one out of the country when we can travel again!
